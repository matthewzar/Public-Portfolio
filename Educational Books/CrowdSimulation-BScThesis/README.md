# Abstract

There is a great deal of literature available on the topic of crowd simulation, but far less focusing on model comparisons. This paper takes the most prominent models, compares them to one another, and then makes generalisations based on the results. Models discussed include Cellular Automata models, the Social Forces Model, Rule-Based models and Hybrid models. The primary goal of this paper is to determine what model types are best suited to what applications. 

It was found that cellular automata are best suited to teaching, social forces models generally give the most accurate results, rule based models are most suited to applications with a heavy focus on graphics and hybrid models (both commercial and non-commercial) tend to generally do well for all applications. Additionally direct relationships between model cost, complexity and simulation accuracy were found.

## Caution regarding Citations

The literature review portion of this paper was thorough, and got good feedback from markers. 

However, reviewers pointed out that the numeric calculations used to compare models were flawed. Not because the equations were wrong, but because the weights used were decided arbitrarily - and therefore may reflect expected outcomes and roles for various models.

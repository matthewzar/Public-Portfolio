# What's here?
These projects and programs and small-scale, stand-alone developments. They are usually created on commission from Fiverr clients.

Only projects that were fun and/or interesting get shared here (and **no** sensitive/private projects will be shared, ever). 

## Projects

### [CAD Renderer](WPF-CAD-Renderer/)

This client needed to convert CSVs into CAD files, and display/save the result. This was an interesting problem because:
 - CAD decimal values had to be drawn as integer pixels.
 - No set zoom level meant dynamic re-draws.
 - Rendered image needed to be interactive (i.e. highlighting selected/clicked pixels).
 - 10,000 X 10,000 pixel images meant performance considerations.

# Public Programming Portfolio
Please note that this a work in progress, living document, and is subject to continous change. Any blank or under-explained sections are there as reminders - sorry about that, I'll do housekeeping before sending this to any recruiters.

## Overview
This repo is an informal showcase of past work. Including everything from personal-repo-cross-references, to screenshots and descriptions of less public works.

Most of the education-focused material shown here will be available to purchase on [Code Commissions](https://codecommissions.com/). In those cases, external links and screenshots will be provided.

## Educational Courses
These are videos/demos/courses/eBooks I've made for teaching programming, and other dev skills, at various levels. Some are free and available to all, others are listed commercially:

	- [Developer Skills Colleges Forget](https://codecommissions.com/p/developer-skills-colleges-forget) - an overview of 30+ skills I believe Universities don't cover enough.
 - SkillShare
 	- [Python Mini-Projects - a Maths Quiz Game](https://skl.sh/2vgU7Y7)
 	- [Python Essentials: Password Generator](https://skl.sh/2TDL5eL)

The size and availability of these vary drastically depending on the style and source material being covered.

#### Lesson Source Code
For any eductional material that uses source code, you'll be able to find the content in our [Lesson Code Repo](https://github.com/CodeCommissions/mini-projects-collection).
 
## Reviews and Freelancing profiles
It's usually a good idea to a get a 3rd parties opinion on someone before judging them. For that reason, you can find most of my online profiles (or at least those that have reviews/feedback from customers or fellow devs) here:

#### [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/users/matthew_zar/)
Both freelance development and programming tutoring (note that certain items are unlisted, or the profile is paused, because I can't always keep up with demand).
 > Absolutely brilliant coder.. very insightful... Extremely rapid and high quality implementation of the task. Excellent communication and provided excellent documentation as well. 
 
 > Perfect as always.
 
 > Matthew did a great job as always. Highly recommended. Will continue to work with him.

#### [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/tutors/online-tutors/Matthew-F-05446/)
Tutoring and written lesson on: Python, C#, Java, and CS theory. Some student reviews:
 > No words to describe Matt! He is just amazing! Every time I have issues or doubts about python, he will help me right away! 
 
 > Matthew is really cool. He is patient and knows his stuff.  I would really recommend Matthew as [a] tutor.
 
 > Great tutor strongly recommend his help!!!

## Team Projects (NDA-covered IP)
Work done with a full-time production team. Generally, these works are protected IP and will therefore only contain publicly-available screenshots and descriptions.
 - Android Game Lobby - think "Google Play Store"
 - Alchemy Games - Thunderstruck, Ladies Night, Goddess of Egypt, Aztec Queen, Spring Break
 - Octane Game Engine - not unlike Construct 2, or Unreal, just more focused on casino games.

## Solo In-house Tools (NDA-covered IP)
Tools created - either in my spare time or under instruction - that helped make production easier/better/faster but will not (or cannot) be made public.
 - JLog - a tiny desktop toolbar for seamless, rapid, JIRA interaction.
 - Forge - Game prototyping layout generator. Lets artists experiment with asset interactions, without any code.

## Mini Projects
Mini projects are typically programs made for fun, or to learn/practice a very specific concept. Some entries are basically programming exercises from websites, others are more independent.
Here are some examples of what will eventually belong here:
 - [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Anarki) - solutions and authored Katas (the more interesting ones at least).
 - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions
 - Hackathon-style programs. Generally written fast and for fun.
	 - [Minesweeper](Fun-And-Games/Minesweeper/README.md) 
	 - [Checkers](Fun-And-Games/Checkers/README.md) 
	 - Bingo
	 - Sudoku

## Large Personal Projects
These are for fun and/or profit. Profit-oriented project will have descriptions, but only non-profit projects will have source code listed. You can typically distinguish between large-projects and mini-project by whether or not there is an associated installer (or usage documentation).

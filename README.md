# Developer Portfolio
Please note that this a work in progress, living document, and is subject to continuous change (as is the entire repo). Apologies for any blank or under-explained areas, which will be updated as time permits.

While not actively seeking a full-time developer role, I would be open to offers for mid-to-senior developer roles within Toronto. Feel free to contact me via details listed [here](https://github.com/matthewzar)<sup>sign-in required to avoid spam bots</sup>.

## Repo Overview
This repo is an informal showcase of past works. Including everything from pet projects, to screenshots and descriptions of less public works (NDAs and IP limitations permitting).

## Freelancing profiles and reviews
We trust online reviews for products, so why not people? You can find most of my online profiles (or at least those that have reviews/feedback from customers or fellow devs) here:

#### [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/users/matthew_zar/)
I offer both freelance development and programming tutoring. Because I can't always keep up with demand (and existing obligations take precedent over new customers), certain services may be unlisted and/or my profile may be paused. 

Some client reviews:
 > Absolutely brilliant coder.. very insightful... Extremely rapid and high quality implementation of the task. Excellent communication and provided excellent documentation as well. 
 
 > Perfect as always.
 
 > Matthew did a great job as always. Highly recommended. Will continue to work with him.

#### [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/tutors/online-tutors/Matthew-F-05446/)
Chegg offers a variety of academic services. I personally contribute via both live video tutoring, and written lessons. In my experience, being able to teach a live lesson (at a moment's notice) requires both an advanced level of topical expertise, and the ability to communicate **clearly** - poor communication leads to confused students.

 I mostly cover Python, C#, Java, and CS theory. Some student reviews:
 > No words to describe Matt! He is just amazing! Every time I have issues or doubts about python, he will help me right away! 
 
 > Matthew is really cool. He is patient and knows his stuff.  I would really recommend Matthew as [a] tutor.
 
 > Great tutor strongly recommend his help!!!

## Creating Educational Content
Most of the education-focused material shown here will eventually be available to purchase at [Code Commissions](https://codecommissions.com/). Samples such as screenshots or intro videos, will be listed here - while the full product will linked to externally. 

These are videos/demos/courses/eBooks I've made that teach programming, and other developer skills, at various levels. Some are free and available to all, others are listed commercially:
 - Code Commissions (my personal site)
	- [Developer Skills Colleges Forget](https://codecommissions.com/p/developer-skills-colleges-forget) - an overview of 30+ skills I believe Universities don't cover enough.
 - SkillShare
 	- [Python Mini-Projects - a Maths Quiz Game](https://skl.sh/2vgU7Y7)
 	- [Python Essentials: Password Generator](https://skl.sh/2TDL5eL)
	- [Python Essentials: Card Deck Class in 3 Steps](https://skl.sh/2OWSFjM) 
 - [Quora Questions](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Funcke/) - not technically a course, but somewhere that I can practice answering both technical and non-technical questions (while also, hopefully, offering insight to other developers).
 - Smashwords 
	- [Sudoku Sage: 366 Apprentice Puzzles](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/428322) - a programmatically generated book of Sudoku puzzles.
 - Udemy, Safari Books Online, and Lynda are all sites I plan to publish larger projects to in the future (such as amalgamations of related SkillShare mini-courses).

The size and availability of these vary drastically depending on the style and source material being covered. Therefore, associated updates here may be far apart.

#### Lesson Source Code
For most educational material listed above you'll be able to find associated source code (where appropriate) in one of our [Code Commissions repos](https://github.com/CodeCommissions/).

## Team Projects (NDA-covered IP)
These are works done with a full-time production team. Generally, they are protected IP and will therefore only contain publicly-available screenshots and descriptions.
 - Android Game Lobby.
 	- Think of a mobile app store, with per-company custom branding and theming.
 - Alchemy Games. 
	- Alchemy was the game engine used.
 	- Delivered games include Thunderstruck, Ladies Night, Goddess of Egypt, Aztec Queen, and Spring Break. 
 - Octane Game Engine. 
 	- Creating an in-house game engine (Octane). Not unlike Construct 2 or Unreal, just more focused on casino games.
	- My primary contribution was on the dynamic layout sub-engine - a set of relationships between UI elements that rearrange the game to fit any screen.

## Solo In-house Tools (NDA-covered IP)
Tools created - either in my spare time or under instruction - that helped make production easier/better/faster but will not (or cannot) be made public.
 - JLog - an unobtrusive (tiny) desktop toolbar for seamless, rapid, JIRA interaction.
 - Forge - Game prototyping layout generator. Let artists experiment with how game assets would interact, without any code.
  
## [Mini Projects](Sample%20Mini%20Projects/) and [Games](Fun-And-Games/)
Mini projects and games are typically programs made for fun, or to learn/practice a very specific concept. They also include commissioned (public) work that presented interesting problems. 

Some entries are basically programming exercises from websites, and others are more independent (such as older orders from Fiverr).
Here are some examples of what will eventually be added here:
 - [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Anarki) - solutions and authored Katas.
 - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions.
 - Hackathon-style mini programs. Generally written fast and/or for fun.
	 - [Minesweeper](Fun-And-Games/Minesweeper/README.md)
	 - [Checkers](Fun-And-Games/Checkers/README.md)
	 - [Sudoku (C#)](Fun-And-Games/Sudoku-GeneratorAndSolver/README.md)
	 - [Sudoku (Python)](Fun-And-Games/Sudoku-SimplifiedPython/README.md)
	 - Bingo

## Large Personal Projects
These are for fun and/or profit. Profit-oriented project will have descriptions, but only non-profit projects will have source code listed. You can typically distinguish between large-projects and mini-project by whether or not there is an associated installer (or usage documentation).

### [Code Commissions](https://codecommissions.com)
This site is meant to share what I've learned about development and software engineering over the years. The site is fully functional, and most of the remaining work is not technical - it's a combination of course content creation and marketting.

## Personal Education
 - BSc in Computers Science and Information Systems
 - [BSc Honours](Educational%20Books/CrowdSimulation-BScThesis/) in Computer Science
 - [MSc](Educational%20Books/ProgrammingMetaphors-MScThesis/) in Computer Science
 - Udacity Nano Degrees introducing [PyTorch](https://confirm.udacity.com/C324HNSJ) and [Tensorflow](https://confirm.udacity.com/4QURNATJ)

### Skills in development

I never stop learning. Ever. And that attitude has let me touch 15+ languages in a variety of niche applications. I'm currently learning:
 - React.js
 - SQL (bizzare, I know, but I havn't had much need for it until recently).

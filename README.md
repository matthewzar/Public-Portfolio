# Public-Portfolio

## Overview
This repo is a means to showcase past work. Including everything from personal-repo-cross-references, to screenshots and descriptions of less public works.

Most of the more polished (private) content here can be found listed on [Code Commissions](www.codecommissions.com).

## Mini Project
Here are some examples of what will eventually belong here:
 - [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) - solutions and authored Katas.
 - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions
 - Small demonstrable project from Fiverr
 - Hackathon-style programs. Generally written fast and for fun.
   - Checkers
   - Bingo
   - Sudoku
 
## Team Projects
Work done with a full-time production team. Generally these works are protected and will therefore only contain publicly-available screenshots and descriptions.
 - Android Game Lobby
 - Alchemy Games - Thunderstruck, Ladies Night, Goddess of Egypt, Aztec Queen, SPring Break
 - Game Engine
 
## Solo In-house Tools
Tools created - either in my spare time or under instruction - that helped make production easier/better/faster but will not be made public.
 - JLog
 - Forge

## Educational Courses
These are videos/demos/courses I've made for teaching programming at various levels. Some are free and available to all, others are listed on sites such as:
 - SkillShare
 - Udemy
 - PluralSight
 - Safari Books Online
 - Lynda
 - Smashwords 
 
The size and availability of these vary drastically depending on the style and source material being covered.  
 
## Large Personal Projects
The name explains these. These can be for either fun or profit. Only non-profit projects will have source code listed.

## Reviews and Freelancing profiles
It's usually a good idea to a get a 3rd parties opinion on someone before judging them. For that reason you can find most of my online profiles (or at least those that have reviews/feedback from customers).
 - [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/users/matthew_zar/) - both freelance development and programming tutoring (note that certain items are unlisted because I can't keep up with demand).
 - [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/tutors/online-tutors/Matthew-F-05446/) - entirely tutoring and lessons.
 - [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Anarki).

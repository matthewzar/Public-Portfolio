# Why 'minimalist'?

This was created in under 3 hours, from scratch, to explain various concepts to a rushed student of mine:
 - Classes and inheritance (TKinter)
 - Event handling
 - 2D collections

All it does is display a sudoku puzzle, and cycle through available numbers when buttons are clicked.

## Excluded content

The original lesson had about 10 .py files: one to demo how each step extended and built on what was already present. It's too much detail for a repo like this one, *plus* (once cleaned up) I plan on making a dedicated Skillshare lesson with the complete lesson as a seed. Therefore, I'm only sharing the end result (no matter how ugly it looks).

## Use Warning

Keeping things simple so as to not confuse a student often means sacrificing style or technique. While fully functional, the UI formatting is simplistic, and use of data-parsing tools would have been overly complex.

Regardless, the student seemed to gain a better understanding.
